## Categorization Rules

These rules resolve conflicts when files could belong to multiple categories:

### Rule 1: System prompts should be organized by their primary use case, not by project
- **Condition**: `content_type == 'prompt' and 'system' in filename.lower()`
- **Category**: `AI/Prompts/System`
- **Priority**: 1

### Rule 2: Project-specific agents should live with the project, not in general agents
- **Condition**: `content_type == 'agent' and any(project in directory_context for project in ['RepRally', 'Trinote', 'specific_project'])`
- **Category**: `Projects/{project}/Agents`
- **Priority**: 2

### Rule 3: All blog content should be centralized regardless of topic
- **Condition**: `content_type == 'blog' or 'blog' in filename.lower()`
- **Category**: `AI/Blog`
- **Priority**: 1

### Rule 4: Research should be organized by topic, not by type
- **Condition**: `content_type == 'research'`
- **Category**: `AI/Research/{topic}`
- **Priority**: 3

### Rule 5: Workflows should be organized by their domain of application
- **Condition**: `content_type == 'workflow'`
- **Category**: `AI/Workflows/{domain}`
- **Priority**: 2

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Tag Consolidation Opportunities

- **ai** and **blog**: 27 files in common
- **ai** and **prompt**: 14 files in common
- **ai** and **prompts**: 13 files in common
- **ai** and **programming**: 12 files in common
- **prompt** and **prompts**: 11 files in common

### 2. Suggested Primary Categories

Based on content analysis, these primary categories would provide optimal organization:

- **General** (431 files)
- **Documentation** (31 files)
- **Prompt** (18 files)
- **Agent** (16 files)
- **Blog** (11 files)
- **Draft** (11 files)
- **Workflow** (8 files)
- **Configuration** (8 files)
